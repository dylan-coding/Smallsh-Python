# Smallsh-Python

A simple implementation of a shell, written in Python.

## Description

This program provides functionality for running a simple shell, capable of running all
simple commands. This is a conversion of a previous project, Smallsh, originally written
in C. The goal of this project was to have a side-by-side comparison of Python and C
performing similar functions, as well as to explore some standard Python libraries.
The original smallsh.c and the current Smallsh.py share most functionality, however
custom signal processing is currently not implemented in Smallsh.py as it was not in
the scope of my goals for conversion.

The C version of this program may be accessed at: https://github.com/dylan-coding/Smallsh
